                                <p><span class="bold">Dental Assisting: </span>I was faced with a great opportunity beginning in May 2022. When I first started being a Dental Assistant, I had to adapt to fit the needed role. I had to absorb information, learn efficiency in my sanitizing techniques, and be meticulous in procedures. By working at Centerpoint Dental added tooth fillings, crowns, extractions, root canals, and implants to my list of skills. I am so grateful for the chance I had to work there.</p>
                                <p><span class="bold">BYU Creamery</span>This job taught me resilience and grit in all situations. It took dedication. As a college student taking 16 demanding, financial-based credits, it was difficult to get up at 5:40 with the motivation to go to work. However, I decided that if I was going to go, I was going to make the best out of it. I sought to bring the communication and joy to work that my coworkers were missing before, and I was able to make life-long friends through that endeavor. </p><br>
                                <p class="bold">
                                        What are your greatest professional strengths?

                                <p>
                                    My greatest strengths include having a high standard of achievement and my desire to please. Both of these attributes cause me to spend the extra time necessary to fulfilling tasks at the highest level of quality. I choose to go the extra mile and always make sure I am working as hard as I am able to and always seek to exceed expectations.

                                <p>Ever since a particularly notable conversation my father had with my siblings and I at the dinner table, I decided to make education a priority in my life. I earned a 4.0 GPA in highschool with honors, I enrolled in a dual-enrollment program to get a headstart on my associates, and I made it into my dream colledge--Brigham Young University. I look forward to completing my pre-requisites to apply to the Dental Hygiene School so that I can continue to use the skills from Dental Assisting in a more one-on-one environment.</p>
